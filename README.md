Supplementary Gene expression and phenotypic data sheets for Reyes et al. 2021. Gene annotation information can be found in Supplementary Data Sheet 1 and GO designation information can be found in Supplementary Data Sheet 2. Raw mapped data counts are available in Supplementary Data Sheets 3 (Experiment 2) and 4 (Experiment 1). For the Experiment 2, DESeq2 and GO enrichment results can be found respectively in Supplementary Data Sheets 5-8 and Supplementary Data Sheets 9-20. For the Experiment 1, DESeq2 and GO enrichment results can be found respectively in Supplementary Data Sheets 21-28 and Supplementary Data Sheets 29-52. Phenotypic data sheets are labeled according to the type of measurement (growth and metamorphosis rates). RScripts for DESEq analyses of Experiments 1 and 2 are also provided. Diagnostic plots used to assess normal distribution and variance for the metamorphosis data are also provided.
