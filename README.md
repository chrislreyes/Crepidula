Supplementary Gene expression and phenotypic data sheets for Reyes et al. 2020. Gene annotation information can be found in Supplementary Data Sheet 1 and GO designation information can be found in Supplementary Data Sheet 2. Raw mapped data counts are available in Supplementary Data Sheets 3 (48-h experiment) and 4 (16-d experiment). For the 48-h experiment, DESeq2 and GO enrichment results can be found respectively in Supplementary Data Sheets 5-8 and Supplementary Data Sheets 9-20. For the 16-d experiment, DESeq2 and GO enrichment results can be found respectively in Supplementary Data Sheets 21-28 and Supplementary Data Sheets 29-52. Phenotypic data sheets are labeled according to the type of measurement (growth and metamorphosis rates).
